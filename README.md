# Password-C
The program is designed to prompt users for a password that is at least 6 characters and at most 80 characters long. The password can only consist of at least one digit, and one uppercase and lowercase letter. If the user fails to meet these conditions, then an error message will appear that informs the user of each criteria they have not met, and which criteria are permitted in their password. However, if the user enters a valid password, then they are asked to re-enter their password, where the program will check if the re-entered input is the same as the userâ€™s first input. If the inputs are the same, then the user has entered a valid password and the program ends. However, if the inputs are not equal, then the user is asked to enter a new password, and the process starts over.
